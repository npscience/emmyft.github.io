		<h2>Open source in the public interest</h2>
			<p>I am the Associate Director of <a href="https://asapbio.org">ASAP Bio</a>, a nonprofit that supports preprints.

		<h2>Past experience & education</h2>
		<p>Previously, as a <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/fellowships/">Mozilla Fellow</a>, I ran open source project management workshops around the world, explored decentralized approaches to data preservation, and advocated for open access to research. I completed a PhD in Neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University in 2016. During my PhD training, I received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and developed a quantitative imaging approach to explore the role of pseudophosphatases in a subtype of Charcot Marie Tooth peripheral neuropathy. During this time, I became increasingly interested how the influence of funders, publishers, and other forces impact how research is conducted and communicated. Engagement with the global <a href="https://www.opencon2018.org/">OpenCon</a> and <a href="https://www.science.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Science</a> communities helped me to build advocacy and community engagement skills. On my campus, I led student advocacy efforts, including the passage of OHSU's <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/academic-programs/graduate-studies/upload/2013-03-15-Academic-adjustment-for-new-parentsFINAL.pdf">PhD student parental leave policy</a>. I also developed programs to grow the local open research community, including <a href="http://openinsightpdx.com/">Open Insight PDX</a>, <a href="https://biodata-club.github.io/">BioData Club</a>, and <a href="http://portland.sciencehackday.com/">Science Hack Day PDX</a>.
