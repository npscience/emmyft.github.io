		<h2>Accelerating publishing in biology and establishing best practices</h2>
			<p>I am the Associate Director at <a href="https://asapbio.org">ASAPbio</a>, a scientist-driven nonprofit working to accelerate science publishing by promoting innovation and transparency in life sciences communication.

			<h2>Community management </h2>

			<p> As associate director, I am responsible for managing and growing the community of <a href="http://asapbio.org/asapbio-ambassadors">ASAPbio ambassadors</a>, curating and creating resources to enable advocacy for preprints, driving discussions on best practices, and assisting with general operations of ASAPbio. </p>

			<p> I am also a <a href="https://www.aaas.org/programs/community-engagement-fellows">CEFP2019 fellow</a> with the AAAS’s Community Engagement Fellowship Programme, run by Lou Woodley and colleagues at the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement. In January, the CEFP2019 fellows convened at AAAS headquarters in DC for a training week to kickoff the fellowship. In March, I shared insights into the current <a href="https://blog.trelliscience.com/an-agile-community-strategy-or-how-to-use-okrs-to-say-no-and-stay-focused/">research and design process to revitalise the ASAPbio ambassador programme</a>.


		<h2>Past experience & education</h2>

		<p> After my PhD in Clinical Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge, I joined <a href="www.elifesciences.org">eLife</a>, serving as Event Coordinator (2016) and Innovation Officer (2016-2018). I organised the first <a href="https://elifesciences.org/events/c40798c3/elife-innovation-sprint-2018?utm_source=sprint-IE&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=sprint-2018"> eLife Innovation Sprint</a>, managed <a href="elifesciences.org/labs">eLife Labs</a>, and supported the early stage development of the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/labs/ad58f08d/introducing-elife-s-first-computationally-reproducible-article">Reproducible Document Stack</a>. 



			<h2>Detailed résumé</h2>
			<p> Speaking, workshops, and other events are kept reasonably up to date as part of an overly comprehensive résumé <a href="https://github.com/emmyft/emmyft.github.io/blob/master/np_resume.md">here</a>.
